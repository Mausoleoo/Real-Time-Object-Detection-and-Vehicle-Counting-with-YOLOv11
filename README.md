# Real Time Object Detection and Vehicle Counting with YOLOv11
This repository demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLOv11 with the Ultralytics framework. In this project, YOLOv11 is applied to a video feed that tracks and counts vehicles, specifically identifying and counting cars and trucks.
