# Real Time Object Detection and Vehicle Counting with YOLOv11
This repository demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLOv11 with the Ultralytics framework. In this project, YOLOv11 is applied to a video feed that tracks and counts vehicles, specifically identifying and counting cars and trucks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to showcase the power of real-time object detection, with a specific focus on tracking and counting vehicles such as cars and trucks in a video. Leveraging the YOLOv11 model, this project can process video streams, analyze vehicle movement, and provide insights for traffic monitoring applications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Motivation and Use Cases

Real-time vehicle tracking and counting have numerous applications:

* Traffic Management: Cities can monitor and analyze vehicle flow, aiding in traffic light optimization, congestion management, and incident detection.
* Toll Systems: Automated toll collection systems can use real-time detection to classify and count vehicles, allowing for dynamic toll pricing.
* Parking Management: This technology can assist in vehicle tracking within parking structures, identifying available spots, or managing restricted areas.

Using YOLOv11 for this task demonstrates the potential for low-latency, high-accuracy detection of multiple objects in real-world applications.

# Model Details

The YOLOv11 model used in this project is pre-trained on the COCO dataset. YOLOv11 is designed to be fast and accurate, making it ideal for real-time applications.

# Sample Video

In this project, vehicles on the left side of the detection zone are counted as "out," indicating they are exiting the monitored area, while vehicles on the right side are counted as "in," signifying their entry. This distinction allows for effective monitoring of traffic flow and provides valuable insights into vehicular patterns at the monitored location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Future Applications

Besides vehicle counting, the model can be adapted for:

* Pedestrian Detection: For crowd control, safety monitoring, and foot traffic analysis.
* Animal Tracking: Monitoring wildlife in conservation projects or identifying animal crossings on roads.
* Industrial Monitoring: Detecting equipment, workers, or machinery in factories to ensure safety compliance.
