# Real Time Object Detection and Vehicle Counting with YOLOv11
This repository demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLOv11 with the Ultralytics framework. In this project, YOLOv11 is applied to a video feed that tracks and counts vehicles, specifically identifying and counting cars and trucks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Project Overview

The objective of this project is to showcase the power of real-time object detection, with a specific focus on tracking and counting vehicles such as cars and trucks in a video. Leveraging the YOLOv11 model, this project can process video streams, analyze vehicle movement, and provide insights for traffic monitoring applications.

# Motivation and Use Cases

Real-time vehicle tracking and counting have numerous applications:

* Traffic Management: Cities can monitor and analyze vehicle flow, aiding in traffic light optimization, congestion management, and incident detection.
* Toll Systems: Automated toll collection systems can use real-time detection to classify and count vehicles, allowing for dynamic toll pricing.
* Parking Management: This technology can assist in vehicle tracking within parking structures, identifying available spots, or managing restricted areas.

Using YOLOv11 for this task demonstrates the potential for low-latency, high-accuracy detection of multiple objects in real-world applications.

# Future Applications

Besides vehicle counting, the model can be adapted for:

* Pedestrian Detection: For crowd control, safety monitoring, and foot traffic analysis.
* Animal Tracking: Monitoring wildlife in conservation projects or identifying animal crossings on roads.
* Industrial Monitoring: Detecting equipment, workers, or machinery in factories to ensure safety compliance.
